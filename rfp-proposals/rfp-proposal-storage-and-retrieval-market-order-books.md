# Project Description

Although storage deals are on chain, storage market asks in which miners create price offers for their storage are off chain in Filecoin.

We want to build a single operator service that will aggegrate data around storage and retrival asks helping the storage clients seeking to make deals and increase global awareness around pricing.

## Deliverables

- A service that:

  - queries all Storage Miner Actors for their current `StorageAsk`.
  - Aggegrates the above data to create historical records.

- An API for the above service:

  - conforming to industry best practices.

- A user interface for the above endpoints:

  - Home Page:
    - Table displaying Storage Miner storage ask + various analytics.
  - Specific Storage Miner `StorageAsk` history:
    - Clicking on a particular storage miner entry on the home page opens this page.
    - Shows trends in `StorageAsk` fluctuation of the particular storage miner.

- Tutorial workflow with demo usage.
- Well-documented, human-readable codebase.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Getting vantage ü§î

1. Scope of service:

   - Finalizing API Spec Sheet.

2. and how to go about building the service:
   - Architectural design vantage of the service.

Duration: 2 weeks
Funding Required: \$5,740

### Milestone 3: üê∂-fooding the service:

A StorageAsk Insight UI for the above endpoints:

1. Home Page:
   - Table displaying Storage Miner storage ask + various analytics.
2. Specific Storage Miner `StorageAsk` history:
   - Clicking on a particular storage miner entry on the home page opens this page.
   - Shows trends in `StorageAsk` fluctuation of the particular storage miner.

People Involved:

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Maintenance:

- After project completion, maintaining and iterating on user feedback on the system actively for the next 3 months. Bug fixes, if any.
- For 1 year: support if the system goes down.

Upgrade Plans:

As we approach mainnet launch, feedback from storage clients will help us better tailor the pricing proposal. We plan to analyze the network activity and incorporate the highly requested use-cases in the tool.

## Relevant Experience

Our team is currently deep diving into understanding incentives for participation for core actors involved in upcoming projects that use PoS. Filecoin is one of the most ambitious projects to launch in this year and would provide a lot of exciting opportunities to understand user adoption and the challenges they face while operating in such a novel paradigm.

We see this proposal as an opportunity to observe the network evolution more closely by building tools that we ourselves would use + helping the community at large.
